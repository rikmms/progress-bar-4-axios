# Axios Progress Bar

This module aims to provide a simple usage of a progress bar for the HTTP requests made by Web applications that use the library [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). It's high inspired in the module [angular-loading-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-loading-bar) and uses the awesome [nprogress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nprogress) module to display the loading bar in the Browser.

**Attention:** This module is not bound to any framework. You can use it in any Web application that uses axios.

### Installation
It's available through the NPM package:

    npm install --save axios
    npm install --save axios-progress-bar

Or via CDN:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rikmms/progress-bar-4-axios/0a3acf92/dist/index.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
````

---

### Usage
Invoke (only one time) the function: `loadProgressBar(config, instance)`.

### Nprogress Config
The `config` argument is the configuration object for the [nprogress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nprogress) and is not required. Its properties can be seen [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nprogress#configuration).

### Custom Axios Instance
You can pass a [Custom Axios Instance](https://github.com/axios/axios#custom-instance-defaults) as a second argument if needed, the argument is not required. If you don't set the `instance` argument the default axios instance will be used.




__Also, you need to import the CSS file ([nprogress.css](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rikmms/progress-bar-4-axios/0a3acf92/dist/nprogress.css)) that contains the customization of the progress bar.__


#### Example in ES6 using the import statement
```js
import { loadProgressBar } from 'axios-progress-bar'

loadProgressBar()
...
````
Don't forget to import the CSS in the HTML, or through JavaScript with some module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-css).
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rikmms/progress-bar-4-axios/0a3acf92/dist/nprogress.css" />
```
```js
import 'axios-progress-bar/dist/nprogress.css'
```

#### Example using plain HTML and JavaScript in the Browser
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rikmms/progress-bar-4-axios/0a3acf92/dist/nprogress.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rikmms/progress-bar-4-axios/0a3acf92/dist/index.js"></script>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
        loadProgressBar()
        ...
    </script>
    
</html>
```

### Disable progress bar for specific axios requests
Sometimes we don't want to show the progress bar for an axios request (like UX which have degradeable typeaheads).  
To prevent it from popping up for that request, you can pass in `false` for the `progress` parameter in your axios request.
```js
axios.get('URL', { progress: false })  
axios.post('URL', data, { progress: false })
```

### Tip
The CSS file contains the properties from the [nprogress style](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress/blob/master/nprogress.css). However, It's possible to override the properties or set new ones with a custom CSS.

In the next example, the custom CSS only changes the color of the progress bar and the spinner to red.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rikmms/progress-bar-4-axios/0a3acf92/dist/nprogress.css" />
        <style type="text/css">
            #nprogress .bar {
                background: red !important;
            }

            #nprogress .peg {
                box-shadow: 0 0 10px red, 0 0 5px red !important;
            }

            #nprogress .spinner-icon {
                border-top-color: red !important;
                border-left-color: red !important;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rikmms/progress-bar-4-axios/0a3acf92/dist/index.js"></script>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
        loadProgressBar()
        ...
    </script>
    
</html>
```
